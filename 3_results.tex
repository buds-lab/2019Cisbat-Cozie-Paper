The experiment, consisting of fifteen users each equipped with a Fitbit over a month, produced a data set of 1,460 data points. Each data point is effectively a survey of the user at a particular time. The results presented in this section is a demonstration of the type of analysis that can be conducted using data acquired from the \emph{cozie} watch-face.

\subsection{Overview of spatio-temporal data}
Figure \ref{fig:summary}a details the spatial distribution of data throughout Singapore. Each of these data points is tagged with the users heart-rate, response, and local temperature which can be used to infer faults or issues within the building. Figure \ref{fig:summary}b is a simple heat map plotting the number of responses based on the hour of the day, and day of the week. It is interesting to note that there are more responses in the hours of 9:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00, and 17:00 when the occupant is buzzed and forced to give feedback. Nevertheless there are still significant amounts of responses made outside these times through the motivation of the participants themselves. Figure \ref{fig:summary}c details the daily responses from the participants, and no observable decrease in responses can be made. Dips in responses naturally occur during the weekend. A normal distribution of heart-rate data from the Fitbit heart rate sensor can be found in Figure \ref{fig:summary}d.

\subsection{Merging with environmental sensor data}
Combining the cozie watch face, with additional environmental sensors opens further dimensions of analysis. User responses are mapped to the environmental condition at which they are exposed to, which can provide a high quality labelled data set for training data driven models. Figure \ref{fig:summary}e-f detail the distribution of temperature and humidity data. Unfortunately, due to communication issues from these sensors, not all data points could be recorded. The temperature of the temperature sensor, is on average 0.8 $^\circ$C warmer than the surrounding environment due to the influence of body temperature.

\subsection{Clustering of thermal comfort personality}
\label{ch:userResults}
Individual user feedback can be clustered using unsupervised learning techniques. In this example, we use a hierarchical k-means clustering based on euclidean distance using the Nearest-Point-Algorithm. The results, shown in Figure \ref{fig:clustering}, show four distinct clusters of users. 
%Users that are comfortable 100\% of the time, users that are comfortable 60-80 \% of the time, those that are comfortable 50\% of the time and generally would prefer it cooler, those that are comfortable 50\% of the time and would prefer it both warmer and cooler. 
Understanding and defining these differences in user preferences can be used to recommend spaces that may better suit the needs of the occupant. For example, Group A, which seems to primarily be working off-site can be recommended alternative work spaces that are on average cooler. Group C on the other hand is a single highly satisfied user, who works from a single work-space within a narrow temperature range, and relatively low resting heart-rate. Group D represents our conventional occupant that may be comfortable 70\% of the time. 

Below the cluster plot are spatial distributions of responses that can be used to identify different building climates. The majority of \emph{Prefer Warmer} responses occur in co-working space 1. This area can be labelled as a \emph{cooler working space} for users that would prefer cooler working environments. Alternatively, if facilities management wishes to save energy, increasing the set-point temperature of these \emph{over-cooled} spaces may be a low effort solution which may simultaneously improve occupant well-being.

%It is importat to note that the data is not representative of a single space. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:map}, responses were made throughout Singapore. GPS data can support in localising responses to individual buildings, but also comes with issues which will be discussed in Section \ref{ch:localisation}.


%It is important to note here that the data is not entirely representative of a single building space, as the user may have given feedback while having lunch outside. There are even feedback results made outside of working hours as seen in \ref{fig:hourPlot} \ref{fig:responseRate}. Conclusions such as "Building Zone A was comfortable 80\% of the time" can therefore not be made. This will be further discussed in Section \ref{ch:discussion}.

% \subsection{Influence of Heart-Rate}

% It is widely known that heart-rate influences metabolic activity, and therefore an occupants comfort preference. Figure \ref{fig:heartHist} details the number of responses for each thermal response based on the heart rate. [INSERT NUMBER HERE ] \% of "Prefer Cooler" responses occurred during higher metabolic activity when the heart rate was greater than 100 beats per minute. If we filter out these responses,and apply the same algorithms detailed in Section \ref{ch:userResults}, we see a slightly different response and clustering pattern, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:lowHeartUsers}.

% \subsection{Evaluational of user comfort over a day}

% Figure \ref{fig:hourPlot} details a simple heat-map where the user comfort feedback is mapped to the hour of the day. Users appear to be comfortable on average [INSERT NUMEBR HERE] \% of the time, and there are no statistically significant trends during working hours (9:00 - 17:00). Variations in user comfort feedback during the day can be used to infer an issue within the building.

% It is interesting to note that there are more responses in the hours of 9:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00, and 17:00 when the occupant is buzzed and forced to give feedback. Nevertheless there are still significant amounts of responses made outside these times through the motivation of the participants themselves. Figure \ref{fig:summary}c details the daily responses from the participants, and no observable decrease in responses can be made. Dips in responses naturally occur during the weekend.
