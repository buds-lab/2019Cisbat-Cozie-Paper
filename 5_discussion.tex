\subsection{Large Uncontrolled Data Sets vs. Small Controlled Experiments}

One method commonly employed in comfrot research involves placing a sample of participants in a controlled space and conducting surveys during this time. In this methodology, users are under no control. They are generally asked to work from the SDE4 building, however no direct restrictions are placed, and they are free to move as they like. (talk more about statistical significance of larger datasets and types of results infered )



\subsection{Indoor Localisation}

The clock-face collects GPS data from the fitbit, however GPS data indoors is not always reliable, and often is not accessible. Other indoor localisation techniques such as pattern matching of noise data to indoor sensors [CITE JUN] are proven methods that may improve the results. Alternatively, the research institution may consider investing in indoor localisation technology such as Steerpath which has recently been installed in buildings at the School of Design and Environment. 



\subsection{Problems Encountered}

During the course of the experiment two fitbits were lost by the users. Fortunately, one was found again, however two weeks of data was lost during this process. The other fitbit was not found.
