Cozie is built as a clock-face for Fitbit, a smartwatch with 25 million active users. The application is publicly available for download from the cozie website\footnote{\url{https://cozie.app/}}. In this paper, we define \emph{user} as the test participant who is wearing the Fitbit, and \emph{manager} as the person coordinating the experiment. The default status of the clock-face is a simple binary question: \emph{Comfy} or \emph{Not Comfy}, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:homescreen}. By simply clicking one of the icons, information about the users' location (GPS), heart-rate, steps walked since the last log, and the comfort data is anonymously sent to an Influx time series cloud database \footnote{\url{https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb}}. Data from this database can be queried with an API key that can be provided to the manager. 

If the manager is interested as to why the user is feeling discomfort, then there is a range of additional questions that can be configured using the cellphone that the Fitbit is paired with. The optional questions include: thermal preference, light preference, noise preference, indoor/outdoor, mood, and whether the user is in office. These settings, along with a unique user-id for each user, and a unique experiment-id can be configured by the manager. The watch-face can also prompt the user with a gentle vibration and force them to provide feedback by hiding the clock until feedback has been given.
