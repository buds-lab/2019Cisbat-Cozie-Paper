In the Ma\={o}ri legends of old, there was a time when the sun would travel quickly across the sky, leaving people without sufficient light and warmth. M\={a}ui, a great hero of the time, observed this discomfort amongst the village and went on a quest to tame the sun. Armed with his magic jawbone of Murirangawhenua and a lot of flax rope, he succeeded in tying down the sun and beating it, until it slowed down to the speeds we have today. What M\={a}ui effectively did was categorise everyone in a one-size-fits-all model, and based on this assumption, took action to change the entire environmental condition. 

The way we control our buildings today, is similar to the way that M\={a}ui tamed the sun. We make an assumption of the general population based on a survey of a few people, and change the environment we live in based on these few data points. The issue here is that we assume that all occupants within a building zone share the same comfort preferences. In reality, variations in metabolic rates, light preferences, and noise tolerances presents a challenge when attempting to condition a work space to meet the requirements of all occupants. 

%A recent survey of 52'980 occupants in 251 office buildings found that 50\% of all occupants were dissatisfied with their indoor environment. 


From the times of M\={a}ui till now, the ability to attain data from large samples in-situ has presented a large challenge. However now with
