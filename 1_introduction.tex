- Buildings are responsible for significant energy consumption

- Recent developments in the efficiency and costs of thin film BIPV technologies allow for integration into the facade

- Dynamic building envelopes can save energy by controlling direct and indirect radiation into the building, while still responding to the occupants desires

- Previous research

- Review of ASF Simulation Paper

- Sensitivity of the Simulation on the building energy performance

- This paper extends this work by running the simulation to a variety of building archetypes in Zurich
